# flower-detection-on-the-basis-of-Iris

We've applied machine learning K-Nearest Neighbor as a classification algorithm to iris dataset to detect the kind of flower on the basis of petal and sepal length. The detection will be made on the basis of the nearest matching categories of flower to which the results match and KNN maps it to that category.
